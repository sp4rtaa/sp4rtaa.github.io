          <p class="modalmsg1"> Dapper Danny Ocean (George Clooney) is a man of action.
             Less than 24 hours into his parole from a New Jersey penitentiary, the wry,
              charismatic thief is already rolling out his next plan. Following three rules: Don't hurt anybody,
               don't steal from anyone who doesn't deserve it, and play the game like you've got nothing to lose.
             Danny orchestrates the most sophisticated, elaborate casino heist in history. </p>
